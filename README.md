# Cogni-Glove
A wearable device to make tech more accessible

It is primarily for differently abled peoples to make tech more accessible to them. In future it can help in health care as well by implementing biomedical sensors to enhance it's functionality. By using this device they won't have to dependable on others for their need. For vocally disabled peoples, it can remove communication gap by translating sign languages.

In the current interation it can detect pretrained gestures to perform actions. We have made a web app to show the detected gestures in a dashboard.

### Future goals

Complete finger and gesture detection for complete sign language translation. (also support for different sign languages).
Use of hall effect sensors to remove any strain experienced on fingers
Improved MPU for complex gesture detection and on device detection (edge AI aplication).
In-build mic to communicate with AI agents over network.

#### Cogni-Glove is ment to
- Be a simple and comfortable wearable for device interfacing
- Recognise hand gestures and perform actions as programmed
- Provide a seamless interaction experience with various devices
- Enhance accessibility for users with physical disabilitie

#### Cogni-Glove is not ment to
- Recreate user hand in 3D space
- Serve as a full-motion capture device
- Replace traditional input devices in scenarios where they are more suitable
